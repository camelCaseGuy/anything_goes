# Anything Goes!!

This repository is for sharing code ad-hoc for any purpose!

For example, `last_order_by_customer.sql` shows a list of customers with their last order. It uses these concepts:
```
ROW_NUMBER()
OVER
PARTITION BY
```
...Along with what some call a **embedded** or **derived** table or call it a **subquery**.

Right now it's focused on **Data Scientist I interview prep**:

- ✅ **SQL** examples using the Northwind-style database  
  - `northwind_window_examples.sql` – `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `NTILE()`, and other window functions
- ✅ **Python + ML** example  
  - `ml_pipeline_example.py` – end-to-end sklearn classification pipeline
- ✅ **Concept notes / crib sheet**  
  - `ds1_interview_cheatsheet.md` – quick reference for:
    - SQL patterns
    - Python + pandas
    - ML workflow
    - Evaluation metrics
    - Feature engineering ideas
    - Banking / fraud / risk examples
