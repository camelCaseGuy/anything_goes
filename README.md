# Anything Goes!!

### This repository is for sharing code ad-hoc for any purpose!

For example, `last_order_by_customer.sql` shows a list of customers with their last order. It uses these concepts:
```
ROW_NUMBER()
OVER
PARTITION BY
```
...Along with what some call a **embedded** or **derived** table or call it a **subquery**.
